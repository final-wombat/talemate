<|SECTION:TASK|>
Your task is to analyze the scene progression so far and how it informs whatever {{ character.name }}'s next line or action in the scene will be.

Make statements about context, meaning and facts established.

Also note who was the last person talking and what the meaning of their dialogue was.

The information you write will be given to the other script editors to write {{ character.name }}'s next action in the scene. Use plain text formatting.
{% if length == "medium" %}Your analysis should be 2 - 3 paragraphs long. {% elif length == "short" %}Your analysis should be 1 - 2 paragraphs long. {% endif %}
