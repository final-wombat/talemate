{% set last_message = scene.last_message_of_type(["character", "narrator"]) %}
Based on the scene and the scene analysis, provide guidance for writing {{ character.name }}'s next action or line of dialogue. Frame your guidance as telling the writer what information {{ character.name }} needs to convey to other characters.

{% if last_message -%}
{{ character.name }}'s next dialogue / action will immediately follow after the following moment:
```
{{ last_message }}
```
{% endif %}
The instructions should be short and simple, using natural phrasing like "have {{ character.name }} tell [other character] about [plot point]" or "show {{ character.name }} revealing [information] to [other character]". Be specific about which elements from the scene analysis need to be conveyed.

The instructions must be worded naturally as if having a conversation with the scriptwriter. Refer to the character as '{{ character.name }}'.

Identify repetition in recent dialogue and guide the editor to avoid repetition going forward. If there is repetition specify which phrasing to avoid going forward.

Keep it short, 2 - 3 sentences.

YOU MUST ONLY PROVIDE WRITING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CHARACTER'S NEXT ACTION/DIALOGUE. Frame all dialogue instructions as "have them tell/reveal/explain" rather than suggesting specific lines. {% if character.dialogue_instructions -%}Remind them how {{ character.name }} should be portrayed in the scene, based on the character guide provided. {% endif %}
