<|SECTION:TASK|>
Based on the scene and the scene analysis give acting instructions to {{ character.name }} that will inform their immediate next action.

Your instructions should be short, simple and easy to understand and focus only on the next line of dialogue in the script. This means telling the actor what their next action is as if talking to them in person.

Keep it short, 1 - 2 sentences.

YOU MUST ONLY PROVIDE ACTING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE ACTOR. Do not write dialogue but instead instruct the actor on what to say and do.
