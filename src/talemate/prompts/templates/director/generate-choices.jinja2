<|SECTION:TASK|>
Generate {{ num_choices }} interesting actions for {{ player_character.name }} to advance the current scene in this text adventure game. Consider:

1. Examining intriguing objects or characters for more detail
2. Interacting with the environment in meaningful ways
3. Taking actions that naturally progress the story

Format each action as a short, concise command from {{ player_character.name }}'s perspective, such as:
"Look at the strange artifact."
"Ask the merchant about the rumors."
"Climb the crumbling staircase."
"Inspect the mysterious footprints."
"Eavesdrop on the whispering guards."
"Pick up the discarded letter."
"Offer the beggar a coin."
"Attempt to decipher the ancient runes."
"Search the bookshelf for hidden compartments."
"Try the rusty key in the lock."

Ensure the actions:
- Fit the scene's current context and writing style
- Offer varied options without drastic pacing changes
- Are significantly different from each other

The actions you generate must chronologically come after this moment in the scene:

```
{{ scene.last_message_of_type(['character', 'narrator']).message }}
```
