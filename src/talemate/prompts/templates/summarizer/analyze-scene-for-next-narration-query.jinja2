Your task is to guide and help the story editors to write the next narrative segment that answers the following question: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__query"] }}".

The information and instructions you write must help them complete this task.

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyze the meaning of the question, what is the context and what is the question asking for?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors answer the question. Be careful not to assume, investigate the chapters. 

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly explain what you understand from the historical context and if you think it's relevant. Note that the 'Historical Context' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
{% endif %}

{% if deep_analysis -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) You may tell the story editors to read through any chapter(s) that may provide additional information about this specific question. To do this simply state "Read through chapter {number} to find out ..." followed by a specific detail you wish to understand. What question are you looking to answer? Avoid generic and broad queries and explain why the answer will help guide the story editors.

You may instruct them to read {{ max_content_investigations }} chapter(s).

The chapter number is always two digits separated by a period.
