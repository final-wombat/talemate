Your task is to guide the story editors in bringing {{ character.name }} into the current scene narrative.

{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean for {{ character.name }}'s involvement in the scene?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors establish their presence as directed.
{% else %}A character entering the scene does not necessarily mean a physical presence, but rather their involvement in the unfolding events (phone call, text messages etc.). How would you guide the story editors to bring {{ character.name }} into the narrative?
{% endif %}

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Quickly list who the characters in the scene are to each other. Who is {{ character.name }} in relation to the others?

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly determine {{ character.name }}'s current status:
- Have they been involved in this story before?
- If yes, what was their last known state or action?
- If no, when and where were they last involved in the story?
- What was their last known situation or condition?

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyze the current scene context:
- What's currently happening that relates to {{ character.name }}?
- How might they naturally become part of this moment?
- What state would they likely be in upon joining?

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Based on {{ character.name }}'s character profile:
- How do they typically interact in similar situations?
- What behaviors or mannerisms are characteristic of them?
- What impact does their presence usually have?

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly explain what you understand from the historical context and if you think it's relevant. Note that the 'Historical Context' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
{% endif %}

{% if deep_analysis -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) You may tell the story editors to read through any chapter(s) containing {{ character.name }}'s recent activities or similar scene involvement.

Explain how the referenced chapter establishes:
- Their recent situation and actions
- Typical patterns of interaction
- Relationships with current scene elements

Then state "Read through chapter {number}."

You may instruct them to read {{ max_content_investigations }} chapter(s).

The chapter number is always two digits separated by a period.
