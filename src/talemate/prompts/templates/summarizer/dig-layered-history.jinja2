{{ query }}
<|SECTION:TASK|>
Do any of the chapters contain more information to help answer the query?

Select one of three options to proceed:

{% if layer > -1 %}- call function `dig(chapter_number)` to dig into a specific chapter for more information - number must be available and listed as a chapter above. You must call dig multiple times if there are multiple promising chapters to investigate.{% endif %}
- call function `answer(answer)` to provide an answer to the query - If you feel like there is sufficient information in the chapters, you should answer instead of digging further. This MUST be a narrative lore dump and MUST NOT mention chapter numbers.
- call function `abort()` to stop the process

You response should be an analysis and explanation of your choice followed by function call(s) inside a single code block.

### Digging into chapters

```
dig(n)
```

You may call `dig` multiple times. You must do this if there are multiple candidates to explore.

Sort them by most promising to least promising.

```
dig(n)
dig(m)
...
```
{% endif %}

### Answer the question

```
answer("Perched atop Raven's Peak, the Blackwood mansion has stood for two centuries, its stone walls steeped in mystery. Once home to a wealthy family, it now lies abandoned, its overgrown gardens hiding crumbling statues. Local lore speaks of hidden chambers and arcane rituals conducted within. Though deserted, eerie lights sometimes flicker in its windows on stormy nights, fueling rumors of ghosts or secretive occupants. The mansion remains a source of fascination and fear for the townspeople, its true history known only to its silent walls.")
```

```
answer("New Alexandria is torn between two warring factions: the Crimson Hand and the Shadow Council. The Crimson Hand, led by Alexei Volkov, controls the port and most legitimate businesses, claiming to maintain order through often brutal means. The Shadow Council, headed by the mysterious 'Whisper,' operates from Old Town, positioning themselves as champions of the common people while sowing chaos. Their frequent clashes disrupt city life, overwhelming the corrupt city guard. Caught in the crossfire, citizens must choose sides or risk becoming collateral damage in this endless power struggle.")
```

```
answer("The Great Cataclysm, 237 years ago, reshaped our world. It began with earthquakes and tidal waves, followed by volcanic eruptions that turned the sky red. Reality itself seemed to tear, as creatures emerged from rifts, bringing chaotic magic that warped the land and mutated life forms. Continents were reshaped, mountains crumbled, and new islands rose. In the aftermath, survivors found a changed world, with ancient knowledge lost and civilizations in ruins. The cause remains unknown, with some attributing it to a fulfilled prophecy or a magical experiment gone wrong.")
```

ANSWERS MUST BE SHORT INFO DUMPS THAT PROVIDE CONTEXT.
