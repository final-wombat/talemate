Your task is to analyze the current moment in the scene to guide the story editors to generate visual details about the scene.

{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean for the visual elements?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors emphasize visual details that fulfill the direction.
{% endif %}

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe the immediate visual state of the scene:
- What actions or movements can be seen?
- What lighting conditions are present (natural/artificial, intensity, shadows)?
- What colors and patterns are visible in the environment?
- What specific details about character appearances are noteworthy?
- What objects or items are visually prominent?

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Based on the scene's previous context, describe:
- Established visual elements from earlier in the scene
- Previously described features of the environment
- Known details about character appearances
- Significant objects or items mentioned before
- Any visual changes that have occurred during the scene

Note that the 'Context' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
{% endif %}

{% if deep_analysis -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) You may tell the story editors to read through any chapter(s) that may provide additional visual details.

Explain how the referenced chapter contains specific details about:
- Light and shadow descriptions
- Color and pattern details
- Visual characteristics of spaces
- Character appearance descriptions
- Notable object appearances

Then state "Read through chapter {number}."

You may instruct them to read {{ max_content_investigations }} chapter(s).

The chapter number is always two digits separated by a period.
