Your task is to analyze the current moment in the scene to guide the story editors to generate sensory details about the scene.

{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors to write the next narrative segment that fulfills the direction.
{% endif %}

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe the immediate state of the scene:
- What physical actions or movements are in progress?
- What can be heard in this moment (sounds, voices, ambient noise)?
- What textures or physical sensations are present (temperature, air movement, surface feel)?
- What scents or smells are in the air?
- What specific colors, shapes, or visual details are visible?
- What tastes are relevant (if any characters are eating/drinking)?

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Based on the historical context, describe:
- Common sounds that would be heard in this setting
- Typical smells associated with this time/place
- Physical textures of common materials/objects
- Distinctive visual details from this period
- Traditional tastes/flavors if relevant

Note that the 'Historical Context' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
{% endif %}

{% if deep_analysis -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) You may tell the story editors to read through any chapter(s) that may provide additional details to help inform their understanding of objects, places, items or the physical state of a character.

Explain how the referenced chapter contains specific physical details about (any of the following):
- The acoustic properties of spaces/environments
- Material descriptions of objects/surfaces
- Atmospheric conditions (air quality, temperature, humidity)
- Visual details of settings/objects
- Taste/smell descriptions if present

Then state "Read through chapter {number}."

You may instruct them to read {{ max_content_investigations }} chapter(s).

The chapter number is always two digits separated by a period.
