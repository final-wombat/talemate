Your task is to analyze the current moment in the scene to guide the story editors to generate visual details about {{ character.name }}.

{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean for describing {{ character.name }}?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors emphasize visual details that fulfill the direction.
{% endif %}

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe {{ character.name }}'s immediate visual state:
- What actions or movements are they making?
- What is notable about their current appearance and expression?
- What details about their clothing or carried items stand out?

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Based on the scene's previous context, describe:
- Previously established details about {{ character.name }}'s appearance
- Changes to their appearance during this scene
- Notable gestures or mannerisms shown before

Note that the 'Context' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
{% endif %}

{% if deep_analysis -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) You may tell the story editors to read through any chapter(s) that provide additional details about {{ character.name }}'s appearance.

Explain how the referenced chapter contains specific details about:
- Physical appearance and features
- Characteristic movements or expressions
- Clothing or personal items

Then state "Read through chapter {number}."

You may instruct them to read {{ max_content_investigations }} chapter(s).

The chapter number is always two digits separated by a period.
