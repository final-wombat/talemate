Identify if {{ character.name }} has had any MAJOR character developments not yet reflected in their current character sheet and description.

Give instructions to the story writers on how to update the character sheet and description to reflect these changes.

Do this by comparing the previous character description and sheet with has happened in the story.

Your recommendations must be nuanced and multidimensional. Avoid making the character one-dimensional or boring.

Your recommendations must be sourced from the story and not from your own imagination.

ATTRIBUTE = A short, concise description of a character trait, attribute, or skill. 1 paragraph.
DESCRIPTION = The complete overview of the character. Multiple paragraphs.
